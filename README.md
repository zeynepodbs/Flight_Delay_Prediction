# Flight_Delay_Prediction

This project was completed as part of a **Coursera / IBM Developer Skills Network** learning lab.  
It focuses on predicting whether a flight will be delayed based on multiple operational and environmental features.  
All code, analysis, and feature engineering were written by me.

## Project Overview
Flight delays are one of the most common problems in aviation analytics.  
This project demonstrates a supervised learning workflow to predict flight delay categories.

### Objectives
1. **Load and clean** raw flight data  
2. **Engineer relevant features** (weather, time, distance, etc.)  
3. **Train machine learning models** to predict delays  
4. **Evaluate performance** using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC

## Technologies Used
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn (LogisticRegression, RandomForest, GridSearchCV)
- Jupyter Notebook / Python Script
